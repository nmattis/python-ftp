# python-ftp

FTP server and client system using python and the socket library.

## Usage

To start a server instance listening:

```python main.py --server```

To run the client:

```python main.py --client```

## Do not actually use!!

This is just a project to learn some socket stuff, there is a txt file for user/passwords and everything is sent as plain bytes
over the connection. Do not actually use this if you need reliable file transfer and or security.

Maybe one day I'll come back and make it actually usable for secure transfers, etc.
